# Why-I-Use-Borland-C-Builder-for-Programs. I also use an XP computer for the programs. This is because Micrsoft, in their infinite wisdom, decided not to support help files. Borland C++ Builder has a wonderful help feature, which is super helpful for developing programs. 
I tried the Embarkadero C++ Builder, and it was too cumbersome and touchy to use. It uses the latest C++ standard, which is almost unuseable because it uses wide characters and essentally got rid of AnsiStrings. They have a free Community edition, but they may not let you join. Also, the help system is cumbersome and not very useful.
Here are my take on the advantages of using Borland C++ Builder on an XP machine:
1. You can download an older version free.
2. It uses the older C++ standard which was very straitforward (8 bit chars were the default, but you could use wide chars if you wanted), and included AnsiStrings.
3. Using XP enabled all the help system features for Borland C++ Builder plus the Win32 API help. If you selected a word and pressed F1 it would bring up the help screen for that topic.
4. It allows you to make standalone EXEs that don't use any packages to run, and don't need to be installed. These work for all versions of Windows from XP to Win11.
5. You can view the form and the code on the same screen, and the code window has tabs to quickly switch between files. You can also add files that are not part of the project.
6. I use Borland C++ Builder version 5, which is the last one where you own the programs you create, and can do whatever you want with them. Version 6 had restrictions.
7. Borland C++ Builder has tools for handling data sets and developing websites, but I don't use these. It is simple to use, and along with the Win32 API is very powerful.
